# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
# 2) Convert a float to an int
# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
#
# What information is lost during which conversions?

conver_float = float(3)
convert_int = int(1.0)
divison = 3 / 0.5
a = 1
b = 1
multiplication = a + b
print(conver_float)
print(convert_int)
print(divison)
print(multiplication)
